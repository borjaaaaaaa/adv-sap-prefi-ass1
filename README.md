## Assignment in Advanced Systems Integration & Architecture
1. Define Service Oriented Architecture(SOA).

Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) is a method for creating software programs that depend on network services, such as those available online. For example the Lala-move application it has the 3 services instead of making its own services it use the already build services that available. For example the first services is the google map it use to track the destination of raider, second services is the paypal, G-cash or any e-wallet that already exist to use as a payment method, and the third services is the Facebook or google account is use for signing in. All of that is already made services that use to make an application because if you make your own services it takes a lot of programming and time to finish the application.


2. List and discuss the characteristics of SOA.

-Provides loosely couples services. Because it make more flexibility and more easy to replace, edit, or upgrade without affecting the whole system.

-Provides location transparency with much better scalability, availability and enables service discovery, workload adaptation, and challenge resilience.

-It’s easy to maintenance with reduced cost of application development because of its reusability and faster development.

And many more.


3. Define Microservices.

A Micro services architecture is a software that design where a large, complex application is divided into smaller independent services that communicate with each other with the use of API and each micro services has a responsible of performing a specific task.

4. List and discuss the benefits of using Microservices.

-Micro services are highly decoupled, each service can be developed, deployed and maintained independently by providing flexibility and agility in development process.

-It is scalability because you can scale individual services based on their specific needs.

-Micro services are fault tolerant because if one service fail, it doesn’t affect the whole application.

-Each service can be built using different.



5. List and discuss the similarities and differences of SOA and Microservices.


Similarities:
Both SOA and Micro service is loose couples services because both services is flexible and does not affect the whole application while replacing or upgrading.
It also break down large-scale, complex applications into smaller, more flexible components. And offer enhanced scalability to help the organization develop and deploy apps more quickly

Difference:

The difference between SOA and Micro service is, micro service is relies in small individual services that operate on their own while SOA they are sharable and reusable services in the whole organization.
